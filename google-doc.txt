Idea: A manager for a curated list of links

 1. Intended to be deployed to a website, managed by webmaster/whoever/Hal
 2. Small number of categories (shown in a main page) - still searchable
 3. Any number of tags (search or click on cloud)
 4. Need something cron-like to search for dead links - easy, probably some existing code for inspiration 
 5. Way to find new sites? Google alert? - maybe but still will need human intervention  yep
 6. Way to blacklist dumb sites that we keep finding
 7. Let admin set importance/relevance?
 8. Let user submit links
 9. Ordinary user does not see a login link (or have to login)
10. Admin user(s) can add links
11. Admin user(s) can approve links
12. Admin user(s) can add to domain/URL blacklist

1-3    are necessities
4-6    are super-nice
7       ehh?
8-12   yes

How manual search could work:

Dropdown: Select category or "All"
Dropdown? Select tag(s) (or none)
Search field (can be blank if tags selected)

Browsing the list:

Start at front page - "more..." for each category? Categories scrollable?
OR visit a tag cloud (or list if clouds are out of fashion?)



Brainstorming database tables...

Category: id, name
Tags:     id, name
Links:    id, url, cat-id, last seen alive, 
          approved?, importance, relevance, 
          list of tags (??), metadata (??)
Users:    id, name (just admins for now)





 Stories (if Iâ€™m writing these right):

 
A user (guest)...


 1. Does not have to log in
 2. Does not see a login link
 3. Can view all/most categories at once
 4. Can see the top (?) links in each category
 5. Can switch to a single-category view (scrollable?)
 6. Can switch to a tag view (cloud?) with clickable tags
 7. Can search the titles by keyword (within category? with tag?)
 8. Can submit a link for admin approval (with category/tag suggestions)


An admin user...


 9. Can add/delete a category
10. Can add/delete a tag
11. Can add/delete a link
12. Can edit a link (title, category, tags)
13. Can approve a submitted link
14. Can add rules to blacklist (at least domain, maybe others)
15. Can configure the crawler (categories, keywords, ...)

The Crawler...


16. Runs automatically from time to time
17. Finds new links (via Google alert??) by keyword
18. Weeds out existing links
19. Weeds out according to blacklist
20. Adds to queue for admin approval
